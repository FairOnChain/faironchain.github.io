FairOnChain is an ambitious European collaboration aiming to develop a publicly accessible infrastructure that enables easy access and searchability of **blockchain data** in accordance with the [**FAIR** principles of open science](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/){:target="_blank"}. This infrastructure aims to promote complete transparency and reproducibility of scientific analysis results in the blockchain field, thereby facilitating the growth and collaboration of new and existing applications.

This project is based upon participation in the CHIST-ERA 2022 call for <a href="https://www.chistera.eu/call-ord-announcement" target="_blank">Open & Re-usable Research Data and Software (ORD)</a>.

### *F*indable
Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services.

<span class="la la-universal-access"></span>
### *A*ccessible
Once the users finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

### *I*nteroperable
The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

### *R*eusable
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

## Motivation

Blockchains are built on a distributed network of computers collaborating to create a robust
data store with high integrity.
At the core, blockchains operate on transparent ledgers that store transactions.

Distributed ledgers, on their own, donâ€™t always offer consistent, indexed, and user-friendly representations. 
Each blockchain is tailored to **specific use-case requirements**.
This can make accessing and interpreting information a daunting task.

FairOnChain aims to address this problem by creating an **open** infrastructure to **access**, **analyse** and **visualise** blockchain data following principles of open science.
